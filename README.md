## Notice

This repository is intended solely for the purpose of learning and implementing DP (Dirichlet Process) on PCE (Principal Causal Effect) through code.
The original paper is `A Bayesian Semiparametric Approach to Intermediate Variables in Causal Inference` by `Scott L. Schwartz`, `Fan Li` and `Fabrizia Mealli` in 2011.


To run the code, please do the following:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run the `DP_PCE_code.R` file.
3. If you would like to learn more about the full Gibbs algorithm, please refer to the `Summary.pdf` document.

Thank you.
